## Description
- This project was done to help develop my understanding of PWA's. This project was to create a simple PWA that would allow the user to add a note and save it to the database. The user can also delete the note from the database. This project was a great way to learn how to use PWA's and how to use them in the future.
    
## Installation
- Just go to the deployed site and add the site to your home screen. The site will then be downloaded to your device and you can use it as you would any other app. If you would like to download the code and run it locally, you can clone the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. You can then run `npm start` to start the server and go to `localhost:3000` to view the site.
